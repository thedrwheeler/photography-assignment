# photography-assignment

You are going to create a web page for your imaginary specialty photography business. Examples of specialty photographers are wedding photography, baby photography, pet photography. You do not have to choose one of these. Feel free to be creative. Your webpage should inlcude at least 4 headings, 2 paragraphs, ten photos, 1 each ordered list, unordered list and a table.

Ideas for headings: title of page/business, section titles for your content, titles for different parts of your web portfolio of photos.

Ideas for paragraphs: About me section, company history, description of services offered.

Ideas for photos: this should be a portfolio of "your photos." search for them on google

Ideas for ordered list: what to do to prepare for a photoshoot, steps to booking, imaginary winners of a contest you held for your customers (cutest baby, best dressed, nicest wedding cake)

Ideas for unordered list: Hours of the business, Services Offered, different backgrounds, different locations

Ideas for a table: Price list, photo packages, schedule of events

Do not feel like you have to use any of my suggestions.  They are there to help you if you get stuck. Try to do this with as little help as possible.
